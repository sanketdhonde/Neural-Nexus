## Project Details

### Overview
AyurVention is an AI-powered Ayurvedic health assistant that integrates modern AI technologies with ancient Ayurvedic principles. It provides skin disease diagnosis, plant recognition for herbal remedies, Ayurvedic prescription recommendations, mental health assessment, meditation guidance, diet planning, and a carbon footprint analysis of Ayurveda vs. Allopathy. The platform leverages AI, computer vision, and natural language processing to offer a holistic, personalized healthcare experience.

### Problem Statement
Modern healthcare often lacks holistic, preventive, and natural treatment approaches. Many people struggle to find reliable Ayurvedic alternatives for common health conditions, and there is a gap in integrating AI with traditional medicine. Additionally, there is limited awareness of Ayurveda's environmental benefits compared to conventional medicine

### Solution
AyurVention bridges the gap between AI and Ayurveda by offering an intelligent, AI-driven platform for Ayurvedic health insights. The system utilizes deep learning for skin disease diagnosis, plant recognition for herbal medicine identification, and AI-driven Ayurvedic prescription recommendations. It also includes a mental health campaign with sentiment analysis, a guided meditation assistant, and an AI-powered diet planner. Additionally, a carbon footprint analysis dashboard compares the environmental impact of Allopathy and Ayurveda, promoting sustainable healthcare choices.
